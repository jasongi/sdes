#sdes

This was a task for an assignment in a cryptography unit in my undergraduate computer science degree. It is the implementation of S-DES, a simplified version of DES used to explain cryptography concepts. More on S-DES can be found [here](mercury.webster.edu/aleshunas/COSC%205130/G-SDES.pdf).

    USAGE: sdes <FLAG> <input filename> <output filename> <seed(base2)> 
    FLAGS:	-d: decrypt
            -e: encrypt
